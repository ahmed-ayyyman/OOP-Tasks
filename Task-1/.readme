Task 1 - Library Management System

This task implements a simple library management system using TypeScript.
It models books, members, and a library that manages borrowing and returning.

Files and details:
- `Book.ts`
  - **Class**: `Book`
  - **Properties**:
    - `title: string` – book title.
    - `author: string` – author name.
    - `isbn: string` – unique identifier for the book.
    - `isAvaliable: boolean` – whether the book can currently be borrowed.
  - **Methods**:
    - `constructor(title, author, isbn, isAvaliable)` – creates a new book instance.
    - `getInfo(): string` – returns a formatted string with book details and availability.
    - `borrow(): void` – marks the book as not available.
    - `returnBook(): void` – marks the book as available again.

- `Member.ts`
  - **Class**: `Member`
  - **Properties**:
    - `name: string` – member name.
    - `memberId: string` – unique ID for the member.
    - `borrowedBooks: Book[]` – list of books currently borrowed by the member.
  - **Methods**:
    - `constructor(name, memberId, borrowedBooks = [])` – creates a new member.
    - `getInfo(): string` – returns a summary of the member and how many books they borrowed.
    - `borrowBook(book: Book): void` – adds a book to `borrowedBooks` and calls `book.borrow()`.
    - `returnBook(book: Book): void` – removes a book from `borrowedBooks` and calls `book.returnBook()`.

- `Library.ts`
  - **Class**: `Library`
  - **Properties**:
    - `name: string` – library name.
    - `books: Book[]` – all books the library manages.
    - `member: Member[]` – registered library members.
  - **Methods**:
    - `constructor(name, books, member)` – initializes the library with a name, initial books, and members.
    - `addBook(book: Book): void` – adds a new book to the library collection.
    - `registerMember(member: Member): void` – registers a new member.
    - `lendBook(member: Member, isbn: string): void` –
      finds a book by ISBN and, if available, lets the member borrow it; otherwise logs that it is not available.
    - `receiveBook(member: Member, isbn: string): void` –
      finds a book by ISBN and asks the member to return it.
    - `displayAvaliableBooks(): void` –
      logs either a message that no books are available or prints info for each available book.

- `System.ts`
  - Demonstrates how to use the above classes:
    - Creates several `Book` instances.
    - Creates a `Library` instance with initial empty lists of books and members.
    - Adds books to the library.
    - Creates and registers `Member` instances.
    - Displays available books, lends a book, and then receives it back.

Usage:
- Run/compile the TypeScript files as part of your TypeScript project setup.
- Use `System.ts` as the entry point to interact with the library management features and see example output.
